# *Carme* Multi-Node Jobs

Currently we support the [Horovod](HowTo_Horovod.md) framework over [MPI](HowTo_MPI.md) for multi node Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Pytorch.

Userers can also 
* use [DASK](HowTo_DASK.md) to write distributed python applications
* write plain [MPI](HowTo_MPI.md) applications
* and [SSH](HowTo_SSH.md) between nodes of a job
* GPI is comming soon
* GPI-Space is comming soon
