# How to install Visual Studio Code extensions

Visual Studio (VS) Code extensions are tools that you can install in `Code-Server` to make your workflow better. To learn more about these extensions refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace. To install an extension consider the following steps:

1. Click on the `extensions icon`. Then, type the extension that you want to install in the search box. Refer to Fig. 1.
