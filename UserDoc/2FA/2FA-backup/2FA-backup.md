# How to get backup tokens

Backup tokens are alternative 2FA keys that allow you to access **Carme** when you don't have your primary 2FA key with you. These tokens are used only once. You can always generate a new set of tokens if you are running out of them.

1.  When you log in to Carme for the first time, you are requested to set your backup tokens. To do so, click on `Get backup tokens`, see Fig. 1.

3.  In case you did not choose `Get backup tokens` in the first step, then you can set your backup tokens later on. To do so just click on `Account security` on the top navigation bar of the Carme page and then follow the previous step, see Fig. 3

    To learn more about KeePassXC, refer to: [How to set up the 2FA using KeePassXC](../2FA-keepass-xc/2FA-keepass-xc.md).
    

7.  To use a backup token, in the second step of the login page, instead of writing the 2FA token in the input field, click on: `Use Backup Token`.
