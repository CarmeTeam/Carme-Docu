# How to open a file

Here, we show how to open the file `PyTorch-1_x-MNIST.ipynb` located in the `/home/<username>/` directory. 

1. There are three possible ways to open a file. Refer to the red rectangles in Fig. 1.
    -  METHOD 1: Directly search for the file in the sidebar menu.
    -  METHOD 2: Click on `Open File` in the main screen.
    -  METHOD 3: Click on the `menu icon`, then go to `File` -\> `Open File`.

2. When you consider METHOD 2 or METHOD 3, the `Open File` box opens. In the input field, type the right path, e.g., `/home/<username>`, then look for the file scrolling down the list. Refer to Fig. 2.
