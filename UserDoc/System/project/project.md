# Create or join a project

Resource allocation is small in the default project. Consequently, each user is encouraged to either create or join another project.


**Note:** If projects are disabled in your Carme-cluster, you can skip this step and jump to **Usage: First Time**

1. To create a project, follow the steps given in [How to create a project](../../Projects/project-create/project-create.md)

   **Remarks**:

- When you create a project you become the `project-owner`. It gives you full right over the project.
- If your Carme-cluster does not allow all users to create projects, then you can join an existing one. 

2. To join a project, there are two ways to do it:
     - [Send a request to join a project](../../Projects/project-request/project-request.md)
     - [Accept an invitation to join a project](../../Projects/project-accept/project-accept-user.md)

   **Remarks**:

- To submit a request, a member of the project should send you via a private channel the `project-slug`.
- To accept an invitation to join a project, first, in order to be invited, you need to send via a private channel your username to the `project-admin`

3. Once you are an active member of a project, you can [start a job](../../Basic/job-start/job-start.md).
