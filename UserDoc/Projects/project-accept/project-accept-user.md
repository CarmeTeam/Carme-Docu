# How to accept an invitation to join a project

**Note**: When you receive an invitation to join a project, you can `accept` or `reject` this invitation. Accepting the invitation does not mean that you become an `active member` of the project. To become an `active member` and have access to the resources of the project template, the membership has to be approved by the carme administrator.

1. You can accept the invitation either in your project-list or in the project-detail page.

    ### project-list

    -  Go to `Projects`. If you have received an invitation, the project would be visible in your project-list (if it is not there, **refresh your page**). To accept the invitation click on `Action` -\> `Accept`, see Fig. 1.

    -  Once approved,  you receive an email confirming this. You then become an `active member` and therefore you can create jobs using the resources allocated to the project template. In the project-list page, the tooltip in your `Membership` column now shows `Active member`, see Fig. 3.
