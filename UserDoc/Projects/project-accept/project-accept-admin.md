# How to accept a request to join a project

**Note**: When a user submits a request to join a project, you, as `project-admin`, can either `accept` or `reject` this request. Accepting the request does not mean that the user becomes an `active member` of the project. To become an `active member` and have access to the resources of the project template, the membership has to be approved by the carme-administrator.

1.  Go to `Projects`, then click on the project name of interest to access its project detail page, e.g., `Machine Learning` in Fig. 1.

6.  Once the carme-administrator approves the membership, the user becomes an `active member` of the project, then he/she can create jobs using the resources allocated to the project template. You, as `project-admin`, **will be informed of this by email**. In the project-detail page the user appears now in the `Members` list, see Fig. 4.
