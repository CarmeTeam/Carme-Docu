# What is a project

**Note:** Currently, you don't need to create a project to run a job; however, in the near future, projects will become mandatory. 

A project is a group, where the members share the same compute resources in the cluster. It extends from the [ITWM project definition](https://support.itwm.fhg.de/Main/Risikomanagement%20Im%20Projekt) and it becomes the new entity for the organization of data and compute resources on STYX. 

## Characteristics

* Projects are required by the [FhG data protection and security standards](https://support.itwm.fhg.de/Main/Risikomanagement%20Im%20Projekt).
* Projects have to be bound to a speciffic task, like an industry project, research project, Master or PhD thesis. There should not be a generic project for all tasks.
* Projects **have to be approved** by the STYX administrator. 
* Projects have a runtime of 1 year, after that a renewal is due.
* Projects have protected data storage which is only accessible to jobs/users in the project.
* Projects have fixed compute resources (i.e. number of jobs/nodes and node types).
* Projects may be subject to internal [security audits](https://support.itwm.fhg.de/Main/Risikomanagement%20Im%20Projekt). 
* Projects can have multiple users and a user can be a member of multiple projects.
* Projects have three levels of membership: owner, admins, and users.
    * The owner is responsible for the usage of the compute resources and data governance within the rules of ITWM/Fraunhofer, e.g., data protection. 
    * The owner must be a full-time ITWM employee (externals, Hiwis and PhD Students need a sponsor).
    * The owner can delete a project.
    * The admin can add and remove users.
