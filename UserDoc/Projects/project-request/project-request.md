# How to submit a request to join a project

**Note**: To submit a request, a member of the project should send you via a private channel the `project-slug` of the project.

1.  Go to `Projects`. Type the `project-slug` in the field given in Fig. 1. Then click on `Join Project`, see Fig. 1.

2.  This gives you access to the project-detail page. However because you are neither a member nor an invited user, the information given is limited. If this is the right project, on the header click on `Join` to confirm the request, see Fig. 2.

3.  By submitting the request, additional information is granted. As you can see in Fig. 3, now you are listed in `Membership` -> `In process`, and your status is `Invitation requested`.

4. You have to wait for the `project-admin`  to accept your request to join. If he/she does, your status becomes: `Waiting for approval`. This is because the carme-administrator also needs to approve it. 

5. If the carme-administrator approves your request, you will receive an email saying that you are now an `active member`, and therefore you can create jobs using the resources allocated to the project template.
