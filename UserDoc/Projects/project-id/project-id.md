# How to get a project ID

A project ID is set by the carme-administrator. If there are specific rules to follow, they will be given in the [local user documentation](../../Docu/docu-access/docu-access.md). 


**Note**: You can submit a project creating your own ID based on alphanumeric characters. The carme-administrator is free to modify the ID if required.
