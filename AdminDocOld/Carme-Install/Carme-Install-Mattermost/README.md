# Mattermost install

For Debian and/or Ubuntu based system we recommend downloading mattermost directly from the [mattermost download page](https://mattermost.com/download/) and follow their [install-instructions](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administrator.html#installing-mattermost).

After you have installed and configured mattermost make sure that you create two webhooks (see Carme_Config).
