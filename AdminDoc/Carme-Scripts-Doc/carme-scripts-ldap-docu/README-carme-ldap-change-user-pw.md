# carme-ldap-change-user-pw

Time by time it can happen that a user cannot remember a password or because of other reasons the system administrator has to reset the LDAP password of a user.

As this is a rather rare situation one always has to check the exact LDAP syntax. Therefore we have **carme-ldap-change-user-pw.sh** that does the job for us.
